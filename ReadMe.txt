ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED FEDERATION
MISSION BRIEF: OPERATION IRON BALLAST]

[Location: Bardasha, capital city of the Republic of Ardakia]
[27 April 1991]

Greetings, General. Hope you had a pleasant flight. It's an honor to have you onboard with us, sir.

Here's the situation as it stands, sir. The Ardakian premier has requested President Huber for 
United Federation aid in dealing with a local insurgent problem. Some rebel movement that 
call themselves the Volkov Liberation Front. Their stated goal is apparently to overthrow and supplant 
the republican government and establish some crackpot radicalist regime; you know, pretty standard stuff. 
Now, normally we wouldn't get too involved in a God-forsaken civil conflict like this, but our intelligence 
suggests that if the VLF gets too strong, there's a good chance they'll start recieving the backing of our 
old friends in Rusovia. Now if it's a question of keeping Federatsiya influence out of the region, then I 
think it's best to nip this little rebellion in the bud before it grows out of control.

As President Huber's foremost expert on COIN doctrine, you've been appointed military attache to the 
Ardakian government. The Ardakians want you in an advisory position to direct their counterinsurgency 
efforts against the VLF. Given the abysmal state of their military leadership, we've arranged for you
to have virtually unlimited command authority over all facets of the counterinsurgency effort.

At your disposal is our brand spanking new mapping/modelling software, FreedomSys. Produced on 
top secret contract by our good friends at the Velagapudi Foundation. Set us back a couple million, but 
it ought to make the job of coordinating a nationwide COIN effort much easier on you.

Now, Ardakia has 18 major towns. Each town has 3 values:
- Loyalty
	- Shows the percent of the population in a town that supports the government 
- Development 
	- Shows the total economic value in a town, on a scale from 1-10
- Corruption
	- Shows the amount of corruption in the town's local administration, on a scale from 1-5

You have several actions you can take in each town. These are:
- Build Support
	- Increases loyalty by a certain amount, dependent on the level of corruption-- lower corruption gives a higher loyalty increase
- Improve Development
	- Increases the development of the town by 1. The cost of increasing development depends on corruption
- Reduce Corruption
	- Reduces corruption by 1. The cost of reducing corruption depends on the amount of corruption

All of these actions require money. Luckily, you've got tax money flowing in every month, denominated in Ardakian Napsars.
Your total monthly tax input is the sum of the tax input from all towns.

The amount of money a town produces each month is equal to its development level-- for instance, a town with development 4, it will 
produce 4 Napsars a month.
However, the government does not earn all of the tax money from a town. You will only receive the amount of money from a town 
proportional to your loyalty there. For instance, if a town has a development value of 4, it will produce a total of 4 Napsars a month; 
but if you only have 25% loyalty there, then you will receive only 1 Napsar a month. The remaining 3 Napsars are funneled
away by the insurgency.

The insurgents also have many actions they can take to undermine your efforts. In each town, they can:
- Commit a Terror Attack 
	- Prompts the loyalty of a town to suddenly and dramatically decrease as many people lose faith in the government
- Commit Extortion 
	- Coerces a town population into granting the insurgents a sudden and dramatic one-time sum of money, proportional to the town's development.
- Infiltrate Administration 
	- Corrupts local officials to increase corruption in a town by 1. The cost of doing this is cheaper when corruption is already high.

Now you're fully debriefed, sir. I trust that your years of expertise will allow you to put down 
the terrorist threat swiftly. The peace and freedom of an entire country rests in your hands, sir. 
Ardakia is counting on you!
